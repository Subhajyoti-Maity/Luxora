// --- MODERATE PROJECT NOTICE ---
// This project is now labeled as moderate. It is still simple, but includes some features inspired by PHP frameworks.
// Frameworks you can explore for further learning:
// - Laravel (MVC, routing, Eloquent ORM)
// - CodeIgniter (lightweight, easy setup)
// - Slim (micro-framework, REST APIs)
// - Symfony (robust, enterprise features)
// - Laminas (formerly Zend)
//
// This project uses custom routing, templating, and configuration, similar to what frameworks provide, but without their complexity.
